# custom cms

A content management system, often abbreviated as CMS, is software that helps users create, manage, and modify content on a website without the need for specialized technical knowledge.

I'm creating my own CMS using graphql(Apollo), postgresQL, and nextJs 

## used tools:

1. [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/): Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.
2. [prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): Next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript.
3. [next.js](https://nextjs.org/): Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.
4. [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
5. [jwt](jwt.io): JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.
6. [graphQL](https://graphql.org/): A query language for your API.
7. [Apollo server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/): Apollo Server is an open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including Apollo Client.
